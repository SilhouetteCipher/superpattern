## 2026-10-14 — `knotwork` · Knotwork

**Territory:** Celtic knotwork (pattern tradition / grid construction rules).

**Idea.** The grid-and-breaks construction for Celtic plaits (George & Iain Bain's method, as explained by
Andrew Glassner and taught via Andy Sloss's grid). A lattice of crossing sites sits at the midpoints between
primary grid dots; strands run diagonally from site to site. At each site the two strands either cross, or a
*break* — a wall along a grid line, horizontal or vertical — turns both strands back on themselves. The
board edge is always a wall, so every strand closes into a loop. Over/under alternates along every strand:
the column parity of the site decides which diagonal family is on top, and walls on grid lines preserve the
alternation. In the relief, the under-strand is cut back around each crossing so the bands read as woven
with a real gap.

**How the code realises it.** `generateBoard` builds the site lattice (i+j odd on a 2·cols × 2·rows integer
grid, so corners are never sites), assigns a wall to each site from the chosen break pattern (random breaks,
panels, nested rings, or a plain plait, mirrored for symmetry; field points add extra breaks), then traces
each strand as a permutation cycle over (site, port) states. Crossings are straight diagonals; turns are a
single symmetric cubic between link midpoints with handles along the diagonals (G1 with the straight runs),
its depth capped so the apex stays half a strand plus half the gap off the wall. Under-crossings are removed
by arc length (strand width + gap), splitting each loop into round-capped strokes; uncrossed loops stay
closed. Output is strokes only, so the shared field/contour/Bézier pipeline gives clean closed outlines.

**Params.** Grid: `cols`, `rows`, `margin` · Breaks: `pattern` (random / panels / rings / plait),
`density`, `period` (panel size), `doors` (gaps in panel/ring walls), `hBias`, `symmetry`
(none / mirror / quad), `seed` · Strand: `width` (× strand spacing), `gap` (mm at crossings and walls),
`sharp` (turn sharpness), `fillet` · Field points: `fieldBreak`, `fieldWidth`.

**Presets.** Knotwork (random breaks, quad symmetry) · Knot panels (8×8, walled 2×2 panels with doors) ·
Knot rings (nested rectangular walls with doors, softer turns).
